This is an example of how to make React Router 4 play well with screen readers.

Steps
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Run `yarn` (or `npm install`).
3. Start up the project with `yarn start` (or `npm run start`).

The example was bootstrapped with **create-react-app**.

This is a fork of the original a11yrouter, the work of Almero Steyn.
